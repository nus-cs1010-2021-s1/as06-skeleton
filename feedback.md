# add
This question is jointly graded by a bot and a tutor.

We found the binary executable for `add`.  It appears that your code compiles without errors.

The human-graded marks is missing.  Please check with your tutor.  No marks given for now.

* No memory leaks detected. Note that your program might still leak memory in some situations.
* No invalid memory read detected.
* No invalid memory write detected.
* Your program seems to survive even when memory allocation fails.  Good.
* Your code returns 0 even when memory allocation fails.  Recall that the main function should return zero if it completes successfully and non-zero otherwise.  **-1**
- The bot either found the line containing `@author` and `XXX`, or cannot find any line containing `@author`. Thus, it thinks that you did not write down your name in your submission.  **-1**.

* `clang` and `clang-tidy` are happy with your `add.c`.  No warnings are generated.  :confetti_ball:
* No documentation-related warnings are generated.
